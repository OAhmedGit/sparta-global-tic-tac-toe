# Tic-Tac-Toe using jQuery

For this homework I had to create a tic-tac-toe game using HTML, jQuery and css.

The homework went well overall and it helped me consolidate the skills.

### What was delivered:
* A fully functional 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using jQuery.
* Prompt at the end of each game showing the winner and asking the user if they want to play again or not by entering y or n.
